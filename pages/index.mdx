*This is a draft article that we are sharing with friends and collaborators. Comments and suggestions are very welcome.*

*To the People of the Web:*

After an unequivocal experience of the ineffectiveness of the subsisting institutions of the internet, you are called upon to deliberate on a new Constitution for a decentralized autonomous organization. 

We have gathered a number of materials to aid in your pursuit. The first provision is an Article examining constitutions among decentralized organizations. The [Article](/article) contains within it a number of observations about the professed rights and values of decentralized autonomous organizations. 

The second provision is a [collection of annotated constitutions](https://airtable.com/shr5r9t19gfW7YYPs/tbltBIhUFqZE1tfle), which contains discussion of the aforementioned goals, values, and rights.

Our third provision, [*Concerning the Growth of a Constitution*](/guide), contains favorable practices for cultivating a constitution of your own. We have also provided a minimal accompanying [template](/template) for your use.

Our hope is that the broader public will find insight from our [Article](/article) and the accompanying [collection of constitutions](/constitutions), and that community organizers will use the insights from the [guide](/guide) and [template](/template).
