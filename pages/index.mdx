*To the People of the Web:*

After an unequivocal experience of the ineffectiveness of the subsisting institutions of the internet, you are called upon to create a new Constitution for a decentralized autonomous organization.

Decentralized autonomous organizations contain a particular promise: the ability to solve old coordination problems through the use of computational artifacts (‘smart contracts’) to encode constitutional rights.  **Although smart contracts are promising new tools for governance, they alone cannot govern communities; traditional constitutions and declarations of rights are still crucial for good governance.**

Accordingly, we have created a number of materials to aid in your pursuit of a new Constitution. The first is an [analysis of DAO constitutions](/article). This article examines professed rights and values and places DAO constitutions in context with digital constitutions more broadly. 

The second is an [annotated dataset of constitutions](https://github.com/metagov/constitution-template/tree/main/constitutions). We expect the analysis and dataset to be of interest to scholars and practitioners seeking a broader perspective on DAO constitutions.

The third is a [guide to creating constitutions](/guide). From our analyses of constitutions and interviews with constitution authors, we present recommendations for beginning to draft a constitution. We hope for this to be useful for organizations considering constitutions or in the early stages of drafting.

Alongside the guide is a [minimal constitutional template](/template). When combined with the guide and our [annotated dataset of constitutions](https://airtable.com/shr5r9t19gfW7YYPs/tbltBIhUFqZE1tfle), we expect this template to be helpful when at the earliest stages of constitution creation.

May the lessons of the past continue to guide the growth of the future.

*We are currently seeking more constitutions to analyze. If you are part of a DAO with a constitution we warmly welcome you to take thirty seconds and [add your constitution to our collection](https://metagov.typeform.com/addconstitution). Doing so will allow us to help others by improving our materials.*
