To the People of the Web:

After an unequivocal experience of the ineffectiveness of the subsisting institutions of the internet, you are called upon to deliberate on a new Constitution for a decentralized autonomous organization. 

We have gathered a number of materials to aid in your pursuit. The first provision is an Article examining decentralized constitutions. The Article contains within it a number of observations about the professed rights and values of decentralized autonomous organizations. 

The second provision is a collection of annotated constitutions, which contains discussion of the aforementioned goals, values, and rights.

Our third provision, Concerning the Growth of a Constitution, contains favorable practices for cultivating a constitution of your own. Finally, we have provided an accompanying minimal template for your use.

Our hope is that the broader public will find insight from our Article and the accompanying collection of constitutions, and that community organizers will use the insights from the guide and template.
