<Header title="Concerning the Growth of a Constitution" />

### Introduction

A constitution, like an orchard of apples, requires diligent cultivation to yield fruit. Just as the crop cannot take root in the soil without water, a constitution cannot be adopted without the consideration and acceptance of its community. 

We have gathered below the insights of many designers of constitutions past. This guidance is separated into those social aspects that concern the crafting of a digital constitution; that is, how to collect and guide the common attention, as well as the material aspects of the constitution; a suggestion for the eventual shape and form that a constitution ought to possess.

The following proposals arise both from the suggestion of constitution authors from such organizations as ENS, TEC, and DAOhaus. They are further informed by our collection of constitutions.

### Social Processes in the Creation of a Constitution

Principles:

- Draft in stages. For example, the following procedure was inspired by the Token Engineering Commons constitution process:
1. Allocate initial responsibility for draft to a small core group of between one and three persons
2. Share the initial draft with a small number of individuals and incorporate their changes
3. Share the secondary draft more broadly and give time for the greater commons to respond
- Include ratification procedures
- Establish a record of changes to the constitutions
- Integrate the constitution into a procedure. For example, you may decide to require all new members of the organization to read and sign the constitution.


### Processes in Crafting the Content of the Constitution

Principles:

1. **Digital.** The constitution should be accessible at a URI, stored in an accessible digital format such as a .md or .txt file, and make use of hyperlinks, especially links to any example policies, smart contracts, digital platforms, or other DAOs relevant to the community.
2. **Amendable.** There is an accessible, transparent process for amending or changing the constitution. Often, but not always, this means having a section dedicated to amendment procedures.
3. **Short.** The constitution should be short and focused. Do not overspecify definitions, rules, and processes. As a rule of thumb, imagine a document that more than 50% of your community would actually read. That might be three tweets, or it might be a page. It is not a 30-page legal document.
4. **Expository.** Each goal, value, or right should come with enough context and exposition, often through an example, so that any member of the community can grasp the concept.
5. **Early.** Constitutions should be written and promulgated at the beginning of an organization or community’s creation.

These recommendations are based on a series of interviews with the drafters of DAO constitutions, including those from DAOhaus, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), and the Token Engineering Commons (TEC), and on the empirical practices analyzed in Part II. Along with these recommendations, we provide a template constitution along with a forkable code repository to help DAOs draft and maintain such constitutions.

For further resources, we suggest Richard Bartlett’s [Handbook of Handbooks for Decentralized Organizing](https://hackmd.io/@yHk1snI9T9SNpiFu2o17oA/Skh_dXNbE?type=view).

May the lessons of the past continue to guide the growth of the future.
