### Abstract
The governance of online communities has been a critical issue since the first USENET groups, and a number of serious constitutions—declarations of rights, values, and goals—have emerged since the mid-1990s. More recently, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have begun to publish their own constitutions, manifestos, and other governance documents. There are two unique aspects to these documents: they are (1) intended to govern significantly more resources than previously-observed online communities and (2) used in conjunction with smart contracts to enable computational governance: many community rights and affordances are secured through code. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of 19 DAO constitutions, observe a number of common patterns, and derive a publication standard to support the crafting and dissemination of future DAO constitutions. The textual aspect of these constitutions take many different shapes: from 300-word policy manifestos to to 30-page legal charters to a series of informal blog posts. Different constitutions were written for different audiences, at different stages within a community’s evolution, and serve very different purposes. However, despite their differences, each constitution can be productively understood as part of a broader discourse around governance within the emerging DAO ecosystem.

*Note: this paper is an interim report from the Constitutions of Web3 project. We are still actively collecting and coding additional constitutions. If you are interested in contributing a constitution to our repository or responding to a survey, please get in touch!*
## Introduction
A decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, is an online community organized around one or more smart contracts. Some of these smart contracts are quite simple, comprising only a treasury, but others incorporate complex governance processes such as quadratic voting, timelocks for proposal execution, and complex forms of economic governance. When a DAO uses smart contracts in its governance processes, the rights and affordances of membership are explicitly—and, in principle, transparently—built into the code that houses the institution. Unlike traditional governance documents such as textual constitutions, policy statements, or legislation, smart contracts can not only articulate rules but also directly enforce them. For example, if a smart contract were to include a mechanism for a member to submit a proposal conditional upon holding the DAO's governance token, proposals submitted without evidence of the submitter holding this token can be automatically rejected, such that it is not possible for someone to break the rule defined by the code. 

*[also, add C2A callout directly here, e.g. links to surveys, etc.]*

Despite the key role of smart contracts in DAOs, there is still a place for traditional constitutions and declarations of rights. Rights defined within a smart contract generally apply to a small set of prescribed transactions, each containing a specific kind of data; Most member interactions within a DAO, especially those concerning collaboration and deliberation, are not circumscribed by the smart contract, nor is it (currently) feasible or desirable to do so. Further, even where a smart contract may describe a right, most DAO members likely do not have the technical fluency to read these descriptions in the language of the smart contract, let alone know to look within the code for them; additional language is needed to convey and safeguard these rights in practice. And although the DAO's values and goals may be reflected in the content of a smart contract, the code generally does not clearly articulate them as such, and must exist alongside other documents that express those values and goals. To be clear, the written constitutions of DAOs are not merely ornamental or documentary, sitting alongside an all-powerful smart contract. This paper aims (1) to understand and contextualize the usage of written constitutions and smart contracts within the emerging politics of DAOs, (2) analyze these textual constitutions as important documents in their own right, apart from the smart contracts, and (3) to develop these observations into a set of stable principles and publishing practices for future DAO constitutions. 

The paper proceeds in four parts. In Part I, we review the history of digital constitutionalism on the internet, some of the movements and narratives within which those constitutions evolved, and the early history of the Web3 movement that we focus on in this paper. In Part II, we describe the rights, values, and goals of constitutions of Web3 and analyze some of the stylistic and political patterns we found. In Part III, we present recommendations, along with a technical publication standard, including metadata, for future DAO and Web3 constitutions. Finally, in Part IV, we identify future directions for this research, focusing on work to analyze existing governance smart contracts to understand the types of rights and affordances that have (and have not) been written into them.
## Part I: Digital Constitutionalism, Web3, and Methodology
The early internet hosted a number of notable constitutions and governance proposals. For example,, Redeker, Gil, and Gasser (Redeker et al., 2018) collected and analyzed an extraordinary collection of constitutions and manifestos over the history of the internet, ranging from the early Rights and Responsibilities of Electronic Learners in 1992 to 2014’s *Magna Carta for Philippine Internet Freedom*. They describe digital constitutionalism as “a constellation of initiatives that have sought to articulate a set of political rights, governance norms, and limitations on the exercise of power on the Internet” (Redeker et al., 2018, p. 2).

More recently, advancements in cryptographic protocols have enabled the rise of a series of services and platforms collectively referred to as Web3. These technologies are built on top of blockchains which are poised to radically change the structure of the internet by enabling credible commitments [CITE] and other mechanisms for social, political, and economic coordination without the need for a trusted intermediary [CITE].

Decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, have become an increasingly prominent form of digital institution. While the term is used variously in different communities, all DAOs share the aim of embodying institutional rules transparently within code. Their shared vision is that rights, such as the right for each user to vote on grant proposals, and processes, such as the process of allowing new users into the community, are implemented using smart contracts.

Taking inspiration from Redeker et al.’s survey of internet constitutions, we study governance in Web3 through the lens of digital constitutionalism. What follows is a set of preliminary findings from an analysis of the governance documents from ____ different decentralized organizations. 

[Airtable view]
### Data set and methods
Redeker, Gill, and Gasser (2018) deliberately exclude from their data set documents that articulate the opinions of individuals, e.g. John Perry Barlow’s famous *Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace*, in order to focus on documents produced by collectivities (2018, p. 306). We do the same.

In gathering the data, we selected constitutions from a range of representative DAOs including large protocol DAOs, service DAOs, investment DAOs, and NFT DAOs, with an emphasis on covering at least the best-known cases. Our data collection was limited by the fact that many major constitutions do not have obvious constitutions, though almost all do describe some form of governance process beyond the smart contract. We also sourced examples via references within the constitutions themselves. The raw data set is housed in a publicly available Github repository.

To clean and code the dataset, we took the primary documents and added it to a private spreadsheet. [SCREENSHOT OF AIRTABLE?] After reading through each document, we created a set of columns that we felt captured the most useful information from each data point. This includes numerical data such as the date the constitution was created, as well as other kinds of metadata such as the document’s title, the maintainers, its location, aspects of its structure, etc.
## Part II: Analyzing Web3 Constitutions
### Constitutions create communities and audiences
Open-source communities have a history of debating the terms of their engagement and arguing about what it is they are doing, as well as producing governance documents from contributor guidelines to governance.md files—practices which in turn bring the community into being [CIT?]. A number of DAOs have produced a variety of governance documents to articulate their commitments and orient participants around a set of common values. These texts share many features with earlier canonical texts for open-source communities, but they are special because they have not yet become canonical (or are in the process of becoming so). These documents provide us a window into what different communities imagine Web3 to be like and how they are grappling with trying to define its values.

We include in the category of governance documents such genres as manifestos, constitutions, community covenants, charters, and others with overlapping but distinct functions. These documents all outline a minimum set of common objectives and values with varying degrees of explicitness. Governance documents in general are *performative* in the social scientific understanding of the term in that they enunciate the commitments of a group and serve to orient participants around a common project. Note that by ‘performative’, we do not mean that the constitutions are ornamental or do not serve a real purpose. For online communities they also serve as an anchor point in a space where participants can freely come and go.

![Chart of different types of governance documents](./types_of_docs.png)

We analyze governance documents as artifacts that use language to articulate ideas of technical and moral order specific to a project. A look at the language-specific elements of these constitutions can tell us about the social and moral dimensions of the projects they describe: how the community understands itself within an ecosystem of other actors, how it imagines its contribution and against what forces it seeks to define itself.

The documents present a diversity of structures following a number of genres: 
Some are modeled on the modern notion of the constitution (some generated with the help of the Constitute Project) with separate "articles" that define specific subsets of rights and responsibilities. 
Others emulate the manifesto form with an expression of values and intent and a set of guidelines to follow. 
Some read more like documentation to a software project. 
Yet others appear to be narrating a hero's journey. 

Each of these genres follow certain conventions and "do" certain things. Notably, they are more or less embedded in existing legal structures or even geographically located.

Beyond the structure or generic form of the documents themselves, the language of these constitutions further display a range of “registers,” that is, functional styles. Some are written in what would colloquially be called “legalese,” a register specialized to the legal profession which dumbfounds readers not versed in it. Others try to emulate “officialness” by using particles such as “shall” in an otherwise not specialized register. Some of the documents self-consciously marshal “kumbaya” type phrases and invocations, while others (notably, the ones following the 1Hive covenant template) are notably “plain,” that is, written in a register that is relatively unmarked by any specialized function. This has the effect of feeling the most inclusive, which perhaps explains why it has been emulated repeatedly.

These documents also invoke and address a number of different groups. The documents often speak in the voice of a first person plural, “we” (variously defined as “thinkers and doers,” “community of,” “members, contributors, leaders of”). They often articulate the intended beneficiaries of the project’s activities to be all of humanity (“all humans”, “humanity,” “individuals,” “the global society,” “everyone”), and they also frequently articulate the kinds of users and individuals which the project seeks to exclude. This is done implicitly by stating certain values (such as community over profit) or explicitly by naming (“malicious actors”). Future research may also wish to consider what the “we” represents within these documents, for example what is the intention of “we” and the function of this statement (for example, how the parameters of communities are made).

With some of the constitutions we observe references to other products and communities (in particular the ones that are based on the 1Hive covenant) which locate the group at a particular place in a growing ecosystem. These references create intertextual links to other communities and governance practices, tools, and norms. More broadly, these documents serve as an anchor point in online spaces where people are able to freely come and go.
### Constitutions describe goals, values, and rights
Following Redeker, et al. (2018) we identified the goals, values, and rights defined in each document (to the extent possible) and then coded them into overarching categories emergent from the texts. Our findings are significantly simpler compared to other frameworks for classifying digital rights and governance, reflecting both the relative simplicity of these early constitutional documents and the smaller size (and perhaps scope) of the political communities involved.(cf. Davies, 2014)
#### Goals



Create technology - the community aims to develop specific technologies related to Web3
Spread technology - the community aims to spread in the sense of distribute this and related technologies in order to benefits the Web3 ecosystem
Create community - the community aims to build a community devoted to the other goals

The goals that appear most frequently we have coded as “create technology,” “spread technology” and “create community.” This combination of creating and spreading technology along with creating community further typifies these communities as “recursive publics” in Kelty’s definition. They are communities that come together in order to build the tools that allow them to come together as a community. In Kelty’s definition: “A recursive public is a public that is vitally concerned with the material and practical maintenance and modification of the technical, legal, practical, and conceptual means of its own existence as a public” (Kelty 2008, 3). These DAOs’ goals to create and spread technology and create community can be understood as the goals a recursive public would articulate. What appears to distinguish DAOs/Web3 organizations from Kelty’s recursive public is in the self-conscious definition of community. Web3 organizations seem motivated to constitute themselves as well-functioning and diverse communities of people united by common values and goals. This motivation is reflected in the values articulated by the governance documents.
#### Values

Open 
Inclusive 
Free 
Decentralization 

The values we have listed above can be encountered in these documents, however there is no standard agreed-upon definition of what each of these values mean to each of these communities. Each of these values is a “boundary object”, meaning that different DAO communities will attach different meanings. The values “open” and “free” are classic boundary objects in F/OSS communities, which have stabilized over time as participants debated their meanings. We are not surprised to discover that, as inheritors of this tradition, Web3 communities would center “open” and “free” in their governance documents.

The value “inclusive” is notable because it echoes long-standing commitments to meritocratic inclusivity in open source software communities, but does so in a sociopolitical context in which “inclusivity” refers to social justice/identity politics issues more specifically. The extension of the term “inclusivity” to also include identity-political concerns is reflected in the prominence of the “right to a harassment-free experience” in the constitutions. Further research is needed to understand how “inclusivity” is modeled and practiced beyond the value stated in the constitution.
##### Decentralization as a core value
Decentralization, although not a novel term, has gained a new salience with blockchain’s features and affordances. One of the central premises of these documents is to make a claim to “decentralization”. Scholars have generally agreed that there is no common definition for decentralization(Schneider, 2019) and in the context of blockchain, “decentralization” is the “boundary object”(Star & Griesemer, 1989) that enables individuals from different communities to work together. What is interesting about decentralization is that it has become a newly emergent term that now encapsulates various goals (serving as a means toward an end). Commitments to decentralization in blockchain spheres have now evolved into sophisticated bodies of thoughts and ideas. DAO constitutions hence serve as artifacts that embed some of these ideas and commitments to decentralization. 

These documents provide a window into how communities understand decentralization and how its definition gets contested. The value of ‘decentralization’ hence dictates some of the conditions and precepts presented within these DAOs. It presents a particular narrative of how Web3 should operate (e.g. resistance to corporate power but not founder power). 

A cursory examination of the contextual uses of the values indicate that their meanings vary despite being presumably stable. “Open,” another *boundary object* term, doesn’t mean the “same thing” in each document. Further analysis is needed to map out patterns in the semantic fields of these terms, the relationships of values to rights and goals and to the types of DAOs (in particular, whether the DAO has a financial goal or not).
#### Rights


- Right to create proposal - The right to create proposal (usually by staking) 
- Right to dispute/challenge proposal - The right to disagree with the proposers attestation by challenging the proposal (for example, through staking)
- Right to harassment free experience - No person will be discriminated based on their age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
- Right to exit - The right to exit community as participants please
- Right to privacy - Participants have the right to present their identity as they see fit, which includes the right to be anonymous/pseudo anonymous. 

“Rights,” in contrast to “values” and “goals,” are uniformly and precisely defined in these documents. We hypothesize that they are the most precisely defined aspects within these constitutions because they directly relate to smart-contract functions and thus need to be operationalized in the DAO in a specifically technical way. The goals and values, however, relate to off-chain aspects of “soft” governance and do not necessarily have an “on-chain” equivalent.
### Textual constitutions in relation to smart contracts

Our focus in this analysis has been on the textual component of a DAO’s constitutional documents. As noted in the introduction, textual constitutions are frequently used in conjunction with smart contract governance frameworks. Of the constitutional features articulated above, governance smart contracts relate most closely to “rights”: they provide mechanisms for the provision of rights such as the creation of proposals.

Unlike the textual constitutions, on-chain governance documents have been frequently produced from one of a set of templates provided by external organizations. The distribution of these templates used by the DAOs in our dataset are shown above. Of the DAOs we studied, only Effect DAO has developed a custom governance framework, rather than deploying an instance of an externally-developed framework. 

The textual constitutions commonly articulated rights such as proposal creation and proposal dispute, as well as voting, veto, and exit. Even when not articulated in the textual constitution, a mechanism through which members can exercise such rights is included in the smart contracts: all of the templates listed include the rights to create and vote on proposals. [How does smart contract content complement textual constitution content? To what extent are the textual constitutions above referencing the smart contract rights? Do we have a recommendation later on to what extent they should?] 

We defer a detailed analysis of the parameters and behavior of the smart contracts themselves to future work.
## Part III: Towards computational constitutionalism
In this work, we created a dataset of DAO governance documents, coded the rights, values, and goals present in their text, identified and analyzed the major functions of and themes emergent in these constitutions, and created a light publication standard for online governance documents based on these findings. However, there is still much work to be done to expand the dataset of textual documents and contextualize their creation and use, as well as to better understand the contents and usage of computational constitutions. 

We hope to continue building our dataset not only by lowering the friction of contributing data but also by automating some aspects of data collection. We are working with Verses, a digital collective of artists and engineers shaping conversations around the future of the internet, to create infrastructure to facilitate the creation of constitutions.

Additionally, further information is needed to understand the relationship between the structure and contents of a textual constitution and its observed usage in governing a community. For what audiences was the constitution written, and how does its publishing location relate to these? What are the processes by which the constitution was created, and who was involved in its drafting and revision? In what ways and with what frequency is the constitution being referenced and revisited by the community it governs? 
The data collection and analysis described in this work focused on the textual constitutions which are used alongside computational governance documents. In future work, we will turn our attention towards the governance smart contracts themselves to shed light on and to what extent they are able to secure them.

While we have observed that patterns emerge across textual constitutions and we propose a template to facilitate their creation, they are generally written and modified by each community that chooses to create one. In contrast, the specialized technical knowledge required to write  functioning governance smart contracts precludes most DAOs from creating theirs from scratch. As a result, a number of governance smart contract frameworks and "factories" have emerged that enable DAO creators to deploy a version of a template smart contract with a specified set of configurable parameters.

To understand how governance smart contracts function on their own and in conjunction with textual constitutions or other governance documents and processes, we must investigate three layers of their use:
the rights and affordances defined within the template smart contracts, 
the parameter configurations with which DAOs have chosen to deploy their own computational governance systems from template smart contracts, and 
the resulting governance activity circumscribed by the smart contracts. 
These layers describe three distinct datasets that we are in the process of creating. These will allow us to investigate what framework designers have considered necessary and sufficient to implement governance on a blockchain, what DAOs leaders have considered necessary and desirable to implement governance on a blockchain, and what governance actions DAO members actually take within the constraints of the governance configuration. Ultimately, understanding these will allow for the creation of theoretical frameworks and practical tools for design and configuration patterns in computational governance of online communities.
