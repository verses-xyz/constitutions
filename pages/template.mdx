# Constitution of <Organization>

<!-- 
Constitutions following this template are *digital*, *amendable*, *short*, *expository*, and *early*.
- *Digital.* The constitution should be accessible at a URI, stored in an accessible digital format such as a .md or .txt file, and make use of hyperlinks, especially links to any example policies, smart contracts, digital platforms, or other DAOs relevant to the community.
- *Amendable.* There is an accessible, transparent process for amending or changing the constitution. Often, but not always, this means having a section dedicated to amendment procedures.
- *Short.* The constitution should be short and focused. Do not overspecify definitions, rules, and processes. As a rule of thumb, imagine a document that more than 50% of your community would actually read. That might be three tweets, or it might be a page. It is not a 30-page legal document.
- *Expository.* Each goal, value, or right should come with enough context and exposition, often through an example, so that any member of the community can grasp the concept.
- *Early.* Constitutions should be written and promulgated at the beginning of an organization or community’s creation.

## Article 3:

## Article 4:

## Article 5:
<!-- We recommend that new constitutions begin with five or fewer articles. Additional articles can be added through amendments. This is also a good opportunity to practice going through the amendment process! -->
